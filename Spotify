# For this project, I downloaded Spotify data from Kaggle.
# Then I created a table to insert Spotify data into.
# Finally, I performed analytics on the data using SQL. 

#Creating the table: 
CREATE TABLE BIT_DB.Spotifydata (
id integer PRIMARY KEY,
artist_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_name varchar NOT NULL,
track_id varchar NOT NULL,
popularity integer NOT NULL,
danceability decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
energy decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
key integer NOT NULL,
loudness decimal(5,3) NOT NULL,
mode integer NOT NULL,
speechiness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
acousticness decimal(6,5) NOT NULL,
instrumentalness text NOT NULL,
liveness decimal(5,4) NOT NULL,
valence decimal(4,3) NOT NULL,
tempo decimal(6,3) NOT NULL,
duration_ms integer NOT NULL,
time_signature integer NOT NULL 
)

#Then I inserted the Spotify Data .csv into the table.

#Next, I explored the data using the following SQL. 

-- Select the songs that are popular and have high energy for a DJ in a club
SELECT track_name, id, popularity, energy FROM Bit_DB.Spotifydata 
WHERE popularity > 80 
AND energy > .5
ORDER BY id


-- Select the three artists and the number of songs they each had in the list of top 50 songs on Spotify 
SELECT artist_name, count(artist_name)
FROM BIT_DB.Spotifydata
GROUP BY artist_name
ORDER BY count(artist_name) DESC
LIMIT 3
