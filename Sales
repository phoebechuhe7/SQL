## In this SQL, I'm querying a database with multiple tables in it to quantify statistics about customer and order data. 


## The number of orders placed in January 
SELECT count(orderID) 
FROM Bit_DB.JanSales 
WHERE length(orderID) = 6 
AND orderID <> "Order ID";


## The number of orders in January that were for an iPhone 
SELECT count(orderID)
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
WHERE Product = "iPhone"
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

## Selecting the customer account number for all February orders 
SELECT distinct customers.acctnum
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
INNER JOIN BIT_DB.customers 
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'

## Selecting the cheapest product sold in January and its price 
SELECT distinct Product, Price
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
ORDER BY price 
LIMIT 1

## The total revenue for each product sold in January 
SELECT Product, sum(Quantity*Price) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.JanSales
GROUP BY Product

## Selecting the products sold in February at 548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101, the number of those products that were sold, and the total revenue
SELECT Product, 
sum(Quantity),
(sum(Quantity)*Price) as Revenue
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
WHERE Location = "548 Lincoln St, Seattle, WA 98101"
GROUP BY Product

## The number of customers that ordered more than 2 products in February and their average spend 
SELECT 
count(distinct customers.acctnum), 
avg(Quantity*Price) as "Average Spend"
FROM BIT_DB.FebSales
LEFT JOIN BIT_DB.customers
ON customers.order_id = FebSales.orderID
WHERE FebSales.Quantity > 2
AND length(orderid) = 6 
AND orderid <> 'Order ID'
