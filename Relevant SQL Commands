# I used SQL to aggregate data using multiple joins to select relevant users from a database and group them by activity.

# Use *IN* operator to check whether a value is in a list 
# e.g., selecting the biking and running from the types of exercise list
SELECT * FROM exercise WHERE type IN ("biking", "running"); 
# e.g., selecting everyone BUT biking and running from the types of exercise list
SELECT * FROM exercise WHERE type NOT IN ("biking", "running");

# Select from a table based on information from another table; the query inside the other is called a subquery
# This allows the outer query to stay up to date based on the subquery (should the subquery change values)
# e.g., selecting the exercises recommended by doctors 
SELECT * FROM exercise WHERE type IN (
SELECT type FROM drs_favorites); 

# *LIKE* operator allows for inexact matches; e.g., "increases cardiovascular health." vs "increases cardiovascular health"
# e.g., selecting exercises that docs recommend for improving cardiovascular health 
SELECT * FROM exercise WHERE type IN (
SELECT type FROM drs_favorites WHERE reason LIKE "%cardiovascular%");
